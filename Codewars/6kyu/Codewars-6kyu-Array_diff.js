// ToDo
// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.
// example: arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
// If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:
// example: arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

function arrayDiff(a, b) {
  
}

// Test
/*
    describe("Sample tests", function() {
        it("Should pass Sample tests", function() {
            Test.assertDeepEquals(arrayDiff([], [4,5]), [], "a was [], b was [4,5]");
            Test.assertDeepEquals(arrayDiff([3,4], [3]), [4], "a was [3,4], b was [3]");
            Test.assertDeepEquals(arrayDiff([1,8,2], []), [1,8,2], "a was [1,8,2], b was []");
            Test.assertDeepEquals(arrayDiff([1,2,3], [1,2]), [3], "a was [1,2,3], b was [1,2]")
        });
